## Level concepts - 2nd pass

After a bunch of playthrough, I've come to the following conclusions:
1. The game is more fun when it allows you to focus on speed and smoothness instead of interrupting you to retry
2. So we should have fewer levels but longer, thus with more room to shave a split second here and there
3. Also remove all those gameplay devices that are overly difficult, for example the Upward Trajectory that causes endless repeats
